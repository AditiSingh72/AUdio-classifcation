## About

The Audio Classification project is designed to automate the categorization of audio recordings into predefined categories or labels. By using advanced machine learning models and acoustic feature extraction, it streamlines the analysis of audio data, opening up a wide range of applications in fields like speech recognition, music recommendation, and more.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Categorization:** The project can automatically classify audio recordings into predefined categories or labels, reducing the need for manual analysis.

- **Flexible Dataset:** This project is adaptable for various audio types, including speech, music, and ambient sounds, making it suitable for diverse applications.

- **Machine Learning Models:** It utilizes machine learning models, such as deep neural networks or traditional classification algorithms, to learn and predict audio classifications.

- **Real-time and Batch Processing:** The project is versatile and can handle both real-time audio streaming and batch processing of pre-recorded audio files.
